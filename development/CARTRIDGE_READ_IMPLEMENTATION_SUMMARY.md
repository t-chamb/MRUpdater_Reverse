# Cartridge Reading Operations Implementation Summary

## Task 7.2: Implement cartridge reading operations

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive cartridge reading operations for the MRUpdater Cart Clinic functionality. The implementation includes ROM extraction, save data backup, checksum validation, and integrity checking with full progress reporting and error handling.

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Session Communication
- **File**: `libpyretro/cartclinic/comms/session.py`
- Added `get_cartridge_info()` method for cartridge detection and metadata
- Implemented `read_header()` for cartridge header parsing
- Added `read_bank()` for individual 16KB bank reading
- Implemented `read_save_data()` for save data extraction
- Full integration with Cart API protocol commands

#### 2. Comprehensive ROM Reading
- **File**: `cartclinic/cartridge_read.py`
- Enhanced `read_cartridge_helper()` with:
  - Memory-efficient reading for large ROMs
  - Progress reporting with GUI responsiveness
  - Cancellation support via threading events
  - Save data backup integration
  - Checksum validation and integrity checking
- Returns structured data with ROM, save data, and validation results

#### 3. Save Data Backup Support
- **Function**: `read_save_data_helper()`
- Automatic detection of cartridges with save RAM
- Proper format detection for different save types
- Integration with cartridge reading workflow
- Error handling for cartridges without save data

#### 4. Checksum Validation & Integrity Checking
- **Function**: `validate_rom_checksum()`
- Header checksum validation using Game Boy standard
- Global checksum calculation and verification
- Cartridge info parsing and validation
- Detailed logging of validation results

#### 5. File Extraction with Progress
- **Function**: `extract_rom_with_progress()`
- Direct ROM extraction to file with progress reporting
- Optional save data extraction to .sav files
- Comprehensive error handling and cleanup
- File size validation and integrity checks

#### 6. Error Handling & Recovery
- **File**: `cartclinic/exceptions.py`
- Enhanced `InvalidCartridgeError` to accept custom messages
- Proper error propagation throughout the reading pipeline
- Graceful handling of communication failures
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

#### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Memory-efficient operations for large ROM files
- GUI responsiveness during long operations
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed reads
- Efficient bank-by-bank reading with progress updates

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Protocol Integration
- Full integration with Cart API Builder/Parser classes
- Proper bank switching for cartridges > 32KB
- RAM enable/disable sequence for save data access
- Device communication with timeout and retry handling

#### Data Structures
- Comprehensive `CartridgeInfo` parsing from header data
- Support for all major Game Boy cartridge types (MBC1, MBC3, MBC5, etc.)
- Proper ROM/RAM size calculations from header codes
- Mapper feature detection (battery, timer, rumble)

#### Progress Reporting
- Percentage-based progress with descriptive messages
- Phase-based reporting (ROM read, save read, validation)
- GUI-friendly progress callbacks
- Cancellation support throughout all phases

### Testing & Validation

#### Unit Tests
- **File**: `test_cartridge_read_simple.py`
- Import validation for all reading functions
- Session method availability verification
- Cartridge info parsing with mock data
- Checksum validation functionality

#### Integration Tests
- **File**: `test_cartridge_read_integration.py`
- Complete workflow testing from session to file extraction
- Progress reporting validation
- Cancellation support verification
- Error handling for various failure scenarios
- File I/O operations with cleanup

### Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 5.3**: Create ROM extraction functionality with progress reporting
- Implemented comprehensive ROM reading with detailed progress updates
- Memory-efficient handling of large ROM files
- Real-time progress callbacks for GUI integration

✅ **Requirement 5.5**: Add save data backup with proper format detection
- Automatic detection of cartridges with save RAM
- Proper save data extraction and format handling
- Integration with main reading workflow

✅ **Requirement 5.5**: Implement checksum validation and integrity checking
- Header checksum validation per Game Boy standard
- Global checksum calculation and verification
- Comprehensive integrity checking with detailed logging

### Files Modified/Created

#### Core Implementation
- `libpyretro/cartclinic/comms/session.py` - Enhanced with reading methods
- `cartclinic/cartridge_read.py` - Complete reading functionality
- `cartclinic/exceptions.py` - Enhanced error handling
- `libpyretro/cartclinic/comms/exceptions.py` - Additional communication exceptions

#### Testing
- `test_cartridge_read_simple.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_cartridge_read_integration.py` - Comprehensive workflow tests

#### Documentation
- `CARTRIDGE_READ_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Usage Examples

#### Basic ROM Reading
```python
from libpyretro.cartclinic.comms.session import Session
from cartclinic.cartridge_read import read_cartridge_helper

session = Session()
session.connect("/dev/ttyACM0")

result = read_cartridge_helper(session=session)
rom_data = result['rom_data']
is_valid = result['checksum_valid']
```

#### ROM Reading with Save Data
```python
result = read_cartridge_helper(
    session=session,
    include_save_data=True,
    progress_callback=lambda p, m: print(f"{p}%: {m}")
)

rom_data = result['rom_data']
save_data = result['save_data']
```

#### Direct File Extraction
```python
from cartclinic.cartridge_read import extract_rom_with_progress

success = extract_rom_with_progress(
    session=session,
    output_path="game.gb",
    include_save=True,
    progress_callback=progress_handler
)
```

### Next Steps

The cartridge reading functionality is now complete and ready for integration with the main GUI application. The next task (7.3) should implement cartridge writing operations using a similar architecture and error handling approach.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for large ROM files with streaming reads
- **Speed**: Bank-by-bank reading with minimal overhead
- **Reliability**: Retry logic and comprehensive error handling
- **User Experience**: Real-time progress updates and cancellation support

The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements for cartridge reading operations and provides a solid foundation for the complete Cart Clinic functionality.
