# Protocol Analysis Summary

## Current Status: Communication Issue Identified

### Problem Description
The Chromatic device is responding with single-byte `0x00` responses to all commands, even though:
- MRTetris cartridge is confirmed inserted
- Device connects successfully via USB serial
- Device reports "ready_to_flash" state
- All hardware detection works correctly

### Commands Tested
1. **Detect Cart Command**: `05000000` → Response: `00`
2. **Read Byte Command**: `02000100` → Response: `00`
3. **Various read attempts**: All return `00`

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: 4-byte responses with command ID and data
- **Actual**: Single-byte `0x00` responses

### Possible Causes

#### 1. Protocol Version Mismatch
- The decompiled protocol might be from a different firmware version
- Commands might have changed format or encoding

#### 2. Device State Issue
- Device might need initialization sequence before cart commands
- FPGA might not be in the correct mode for cartridge access

#### 3. Hardware Interface Issue
- Cartridge slot might have connection problems
- FPGA-to-cartridge interface might be disabled

#### 4. Command Format Issue
- Our command encoding might be incorrect
- Missing headers, checksums, or framing

### Next Steps to Resolve

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Compare with Official MRUpdater**
   - Run official MRUpdater to confirm it can read the cartridge
   - Monitor USB traffic during official operation
   - Compare command sequences

2. **Protocol Reverse Engineering**
   - Use USB packet capture tools (Wireshark, USBPcap)
   - Capture successful cartridge read session
   - Analyze actual command/response patterns

3. **Device State Investigation**
   - Check if device needs specific initialization
   - Try different command sequences
   - Investigate if FPGA needs to be put in cartridge mode

#### Technical Investigation
1. **USB Traffic Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Use system tools to monitor USB communication
   sudo dtruss -p <mrupdater_pid> 2>&1 | grep -i usb
   ```

2. **Serial Port Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Monitor raw serial data
   screen /dev/cu.usbmodem0123456783 115200
   ```

3. **Firmware Version Check**
   - Determine exact firmware version on device
   - Check if protocol documentation matches

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Device detection and connection
- ✅ USB serial communication
- ✅ Command building and encoding
- ❌ Cartridge detection (returns 0x00)
- ❌ Data reading (returns 0x00)

### Files Modified
- `libpyretro/cartclinic/comms/session.py` - Enhanced error handling
- `libpyretro/cartclinic/comms/transport.py` - Improved serial communication
- `libpyretro/cartclinic/cart_api.py` - Fixed decompilation syntax errors

### Test Results
All test scripts consistently show:
- Device connects successfully
- Commands are sent correctly
- Device responds with single `0x00` byte
- No multi-byte responses received

## Recommendation
The most effective next step is to capture USB traffic from a working MRUpdater session to understand the actual protocol being used. This will reveal:
1. Correct command format
2. Required initialization sequence
3. Expected response format
4. Any missing protocol elements

Once we have the actual protocol, we can update our implementation accordingly.
