distributed binaries for interoperability purposes. The decompilation process 
involved:

- Analysis of publicly available application packages
- String extraction and module structure examination  
- Protocol observation and documentation
- Clean-room implementation without direct code copying

This work is protected under reverse engineering provisions of copyright law
